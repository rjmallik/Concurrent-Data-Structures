This project involves implementing two critical concurrent data structures in C: a bounded buffer and a reader-writer lock. Both structures are designed to operate in multi-threaded environments and emphasize proper synchronization to ensure data integrity and correctness under concurrent access. The bounded buffer functions as a thread-safe FIFO queue capable of storing and retrieving arbitrary pointers. Enqueue and dequeue operations must adhere to FIFO semantics, ensuring that items are dequeued in the order they were enqueued. To support multiple producers and consumers, the queue must block operations when the buffer is full or empty, depending on the context, while guaranteeing valid data access and eventual processing of all enqueued items. Achieving this requires the careful use of synchronization primitives to maintain thread safety while allowing concurrent access.

The reader-writer lock provides a mechanism for managing shared data access, allowing multiple readers to access data simultaneously while granting exclusive access to writers. The design prioritizes fairness and efficiency, implementing locking and unlocking mechanisms that ensure readers and writers can proceed without violating synchronization constraints. To handle contention, the lock supports configurable priorities, enabling implementations that favor readers, writers, or a balanced approach where a fixed number of readers are allowed between writers. These priority settings ensure non-starvation and provide flexibility in managing concurrent access.

Both structures require robust implementations that avoid common pitfalls such as memory leaks, busy-waiting, and segmentation faults. The system must uphold fairness, correctness, and non-starvation guarantees while operating efficiently under varying levels of contention. This project emphasizes the application of multi-threading concepts, synchronization techniques, and software engineering principles to develop practical and reliable solutions for concurrent systems. Through this assignment, students gain a deeper understanding of thread safety and synchronization while tackling real-world challenges in concurrent programming.
